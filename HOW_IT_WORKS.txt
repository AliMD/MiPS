sending device information to MiPS Server has some steps which expressed below:

1) by running application (which has been registered to MiPS Server), these parameters are sent (GET or POST):
http://mips-server/track?
	track_code			= ...	&	[once]	(application unique identification parameter, auto-created)	
	uuid				= ...	&	[once]	(device unique identification parameter)
	device_name			= ...	&	[once]
	platform_name		= ...	&	[once]
	platform_version	= ...	&	[once]
	screen_width		= ...	&	[once]
	screen_height		= ...	&	[once]
	avail_width			= ...	&	[once]
	avail_height		= ...	&	[once]
	color_depth			= ...	&	[once]
	user_agent			= ...	&	[once]
	language			= ...	&	[once]
	meta_name			= ...	&	[EVERY TIME]	(event or action name)
	meta_content		= ...		[EVERY TIME]	(event or action description) [if needed]

by sending these parameters, MiPS registers the device and user as a guest. and It'll update device informations if needed.

2) for registering a (real) user, these parameters have to be sent:
http://mips-server/track?
	name			= ...		&
	nickname		= ...		&	(nickname = nickname || name)
	email			= ...		&	(will be used as username)
	password		= ...		&
	cellphone		= ...		&
	meta_name		= register	&	[Necessay]
	meta_content	= ...			(description) [if needed]

by sending these parameters, MiPS updates guest (registered before) as a user, and login.

3) updating the guest informations registered by the device, by logging in as another user, will be done by sending these parameters:
http://mips-server/track?
	email			= ...		&	(will be used as username)
	password		= ...		&
	meta_name		= login		&	[Necessay]
	meta_content	= ...			(description) [if needed]

by sending these parameters, MiPS checks users table to update "probable guest", and login.

4) Loggin out a user:
http://mips-server/track?meta_name=logout
